My CS50X final project that is made in codespaces of cs50.

When I copied it on VSCode to push to GitHub, I didn't know how to manage SQLite databases on 
VSCode so it is expected to not work properly. When I learn SQLite and MYSQL properly, I will
revisit this project to make it work but until that time, all these codes are indicators of what 
I am capable of.
