My CS50X final project that is made in codespaces of cs50.

Project: A web based dynamic to do manager that has functionailities of adding and checking tasks.
One can register and login to their accounts to create their own tasks and see their tasks in
the main page with their status, date/time added and date/time completed. It uses flask to
manage web requests and show necessary html pages to user as the same code handles SQL queries
to manage database.

When I copied it on VSCode to push to GitHub, I didn't know how to manage SQLite databases on 
VSCode so it is expected to not work properly. When I learn SQLite and MYSQL properly, I will
revisit this project to make it work but until that time, all these codes are indicators of what 
I am capable of.
